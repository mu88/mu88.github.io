<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<h2>How data are processed</h2>

This website is powered by Jekyll and is hosted on GitHub. Github, however, (like any hosting company) can have full insight in visitor data, like connecting IP addresses, visited pages, etc. Note that Github is not known to actively profile visitors. By using a VPN you can (try to) prevent this.

<h3>Google Analytics</h3>
This website uses Google Analytics. This happens only if you approve third party cookies and scripts. I have configured Google Analytics to anonymize IP addresses.

<h2>Updates</h2>
I keep the privacy policy under regular review and place any updates on this web page. This privacy policy was last updated on 28.02.2020.

<h2>Contact</h2>
If you have any questions about this privacy policy, the data are hold on you, or you would like to exercise one of your data protection rights, please do not hesitate to contact me.
