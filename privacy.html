<h2>How data are processed</h2>
This website is powered by Jekyll and is hosted on GitHub. Github, however, (like any hosting company) can have full insight in visitor data, like connecting IP addresses, visited pages, etc. Note that Github is not known to actively profile visitors. By using a VPN you can (try to) prevent this.

<h2>Plausible</h2>
This website uses <a href="https://plausible.io">Plausible</a> to analyze page visits on a GDPR-compliant way.<br>
All collected data are publicly available. You find them on <a href="https://plausible.io/mu88.github.io/">this public dashboard</a>.

<h2>Updates</h2>
I keep the privacy policy under regular review and place any updates on this web page. This privacy policy was last updated on 30.09.2022.
