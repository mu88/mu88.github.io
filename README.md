# Bruce Eckel's Programming Blog

Based on [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon), which is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.

Just to experiment, I set this up without installing any tools locally on my laptop. I write the posts using [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/), and then push it to the git repository and Github does everything else.

I've written a [blog post](http://bruceeckel.github.io/2014/11/19/using-github-pages/) describing everything I did to set up this site.
