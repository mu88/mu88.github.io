As I mentioned a couple of times, we at Swiss Post strive for a Cloud-first approach and embrace various techniques and tools to make that happen. But sometimes, these tools can guide you into a completely wrong direction if not understood properly - as it happened to me last week ðŸ˜…

## Here's what happened
All of our applications are Docker-ized and run on K8s. To get an easy overview of the applications health, .NET metrics are collected and visualized in Grafana. Here's what a typical Grafana dashboard looks like for one of our applications:  
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/public/post_assets/2023-03-13-EF-Core-query-cache/Image_1.png)

It contains a lot of [.NET `EventCounter`s that you can find here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/diagnostics/available-counters) and we do have metrics for EF Core as well:  
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/public/post_assets/2023-03-13-EF-Core-query-cache/Image_2.png)

In the lower left corner of the previous screenshot, you see the _Compiled Query_ metric, referring to the _EF Core Query Cache Hit Rate_ which is specified as following ([taken from here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/logging-events-diagnostics/event-counters?tabs=windows#counters-and-their-meaning)):  
> The ratio of query cache hits to misses. The first time a given LINQ query is executed by EF Core (excluding parameters), it must be compiled in what is a relatively heavy process. In a normal application, all queries are reused, and the query cache hit rate should be stable at 100% after an initial warmup period. If this number is less than 100% over time, you may experience degraded perf due to repeated compilations, which could be a result of suboptimal dynamic query generation.

Well, I think it's safe to say that 21.5% is not very close to 100% ðŸ˜‰ since the docs do not state how to analyze this kind of problem, [I asked on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75649106/analyze-ef-core-query-cache), giving me some very helpful feedback.

## Log query compilation
EF Core has a ton of additional log statements which are not enabled by default. One of this is `CoreEventId.QueryCompilationStarting` which gets logged when an EF Core query needs to be (re)compiled.

I've enabled the log statement by adding the following line when configuring EF Core:

{% highlight csharp %}
dbContextOptionsBuilder
    .ConfigureWarnings(warning => warning.Log(CoreEventId.QueryCompilationStarting, LogLevel.Information));
{% endhighlight %}

Since it's an `Info` log, `appsettings.json` needs to be updated as well:

{% highlight json %}
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Query": "Information"
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

When deploying this change, the following log statements appeared in our logging platform Splunk:  
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/public/post_assets/2023-03-13-EF-Core-query-cache/Image_3.png)

To obtain a meaningful result, I left the application alone overnight and looked at the logs the next morning. I'd expected certain queries to be recompiled over and over again, causing the bad _EF Core Query Cache Hit Rate_ metric. But to my surprise, all queries were compiled only once, so I had to go one step further.

## Custom `ICompiledQueryCache`
Another hint I received on Stack Overflow was to implement my own query cache and see what's going on inside. I just copy and pasted the [original sources from GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/release%2F7.0/src/EFCore/Query/Internal/CompiledQueryCache.cs) and extended it with some log statements:

{% highlight csharp %}
public class LoggingCompiledQueryCache : ICompiledQueryCache
{
    private readonly ILogger<LoggingCompiledQueryCache> _logger;

    public LoggingCompiledQueryCache(IMemoryCache memoryCache)
    {
        _memoryCache = memoryCache;
        using ILoggerFactory loggerFactory = LoggerFactory.Create(builder => builder.AddConsole());
        _logger = loggerFactory.CreateLogger<LoggingCompiledQueryCache>();
    }

    public virtual Func<QueryContext, TResult> GetOrAddQuery<TResult>(object cacheKey, Func<Func<QueryContext, TResult>> compiler)
    {
        // code left out for brevity
        try
        {
            lock (compilationLock)
            {
                if (_memoryCache.TryGetValue(cacheKey, out compiledQuery))
                {
                    EntityFrameworkEventSource.Log.CompiledQueryCacheHit();
                    _logger.QueryCacheHit();
                }
                else
                {
                    EntityFrameworkEventSource.Log.CompiledQueryCacheMiss();
                    _logger.QueryCacheMiss();
                    // code left out for brevity
                }

                return compiledQuery!;
            }
        }
        // code left out for brevity
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

With these additional logging messages:

{% highlight csharp %}
public static partial class Log
{
    /// <summary>
    ///     This was a EF Core Query Cache hit.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="logger">The logger.</param>
    [LoggerMessage(
        EventId = 50001,
        Level = LogLevel.Information,
        Message = "This was a EF Core Query Cache miss.",
        SkipEnabledCheck = true)]
    public static partial void QueryCacheHit(this ILogger logger);

    /// <summary>
    ///     This was a EF Core Query Cache miss.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="logger">The logger.</param>
    [LoggerMessage(
        EventId = 50002,
        Level = LogLevel.Information,
        Message = "This was a EF Core Query Cache miss.",
        SkipEnabledCheck = true)]
    public static partial void QueryCacheMiss(this ILogger logger);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, the existing `CompiledQueryCache` needs to be replaced with the custom implementation:

{% highlight csharp %}
dbContextOptionsBuilder
    .ReplaceService<ICompiledQueryCache, CompiledQueryCache, LoggingCompiledQueryCache>();
{% endhighlight %}

Letâ€™s take it apart one by one:
- The custom `LoggingCompiledQueryCache` implements the same behavior as the original `CompiledQueryCache`.
- `LoggingCompiledQueryCache` logs each time if the underlying `_memoryCache` is either hit or missed via `QueryCacheHit()` or `QueryCacheMiss()`.

With these information at hand, I could calculate my own query cache hit rate in Splunk:  
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/public/post_assets/2023-03-13-EF-Core-query-cache/Image_4.png)

And that was one of these moments when you should leave your notebook, drink a hot cup of coffee and ask yourself why you've chosen this job - why is the calculated value 99.9% but Grafana displays 21.5%? ðŸ¤¯

## Analyzing the metric in Grafana
When taking a closer look into the data in Grafana, I noticed a lot of of `-1` values:  
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/public/post_assets/2023-03-13-EF-Core-query-cache/Image_5.png)

That felt quite odd to me - where are these values coming from? The answer lies in the [EF Core code for calculating this metric](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/main/src/EFCore/Infrastructure/EntityFrameworkEventSource.cs#L226):

{% highlight csharp %}
var hitsAndMisses = clone.Hits + clone.Misses;

// Report -1 for no data to avoid returning NaN, which can trigger issues in downstream consumers
return hitsAndMisses == 0
    ? -1
    : ((double)clone.Hits / hitsAndMisses) * 100;
{% endhighlight %}

If the cache hasn't been hit at all (e. g. no traffic), `-1` is reported to avoid a division by zero. But let's calculate an average made up of five datapoints:
`((-1) + (-1) + (-1) + (-1) + 100) / 5 = 19.2`

Due to all the `-1` values, the average query cache hit rate gets pulled down to `19.2%` - and that perfectly describes my initial problem: the affected app runs only every couple of minutes, the other time it is idle. During idle times, the metric reports `-1`, thereby bringing down the average.

## Conclusion
There are multiple solutions:
1. Exclude the `-1` values in Grafana.
2. Implement a custom `EventListener` and remove the `-1` before writing the metric at all.

We decided for the second way, but I think it's really up to the use case.

For me it was a super interesting story to see how EF Core works under the hood, how you can reveal internal behavior by adding more logs and even replace internal components like the `CompiledQueryCache` due to .NET's modular approach - and to take a closer look into the reported metric values ðŸ˜‰

Thanks for reading and have a great time!
