Although the Java Posse has ended transmission, we are still having the
conference, renamed to the [Winter Tech Forum](http://wintertechforum.com) (yes, that's WTF -- because we're
always trying to figure things out). Come create conversation, generate ideas,
hack projects, create workshops, ski, snowshoe, snowmobile and experience small-town living.

The dates are Feb 23 - 27, 2015. Many people like to arrive earlier and stay a bit later; activities start with the Sunday evening barbecue and go through Saturday morning breakfast.

The conference takes place in my home town of [Crested Butte, Colorado](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crested_Butte,_Colorado), renowned for skiing and winter activities, scenic beauty, preservation of the original mining town, and most especially the feeling of community and friendliness of the inhabitants.

The theme this year is *Creating Adaptware in the Information Continuum: From
Big Data to Responsive Systems*. The theme is just an idea to produce
conversations, but is by no means a restriction --- you can create any
conversation you think people want to discuss. For example, I will hold one or
more sessions around my continuing research on [Reinventing-Business.com](http://www.reinventing-business.com/).

The Winter Tech Forum is an [Open Spaces Conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aD3S0wlbek0). There are no
presentations or predefined topics. Instead, participants write discussion
topics on sticky notes and place them in a time slot for a room. Anyone who is
interested in that topic shows up. You can end up with tiny groups or large
groups and both are just fine. The best part of most traditional conferences
are the hallway conversations, and Open Spaces produce all hallway
conversations, all the time. If you aren't used to Open Spaces, they seem a
bit strange at first but you'll be amazed at how well they work.

On Wednesday, we have a hackathon day, something which has become a favorite.
Often people explore alternative languages on the JVM, but we've also seen
hardware projects, explorations of build systems, and any number of odd
projects. If you and your team want to build it, they will come. Wednesday
evening includes short presentations of the results of the day.

In addition, the week is packed with other activities (wherein, we've
discovered, some of the best technical conversations take place despite our
attempts to recreate). Afternoons are open to allow for skiing and other outdoor activities, but just as often fill up with user-organized workshops. Evening events include barbecues, 5-minute lightning talks (by you), and pub discussions. Thursday is our very popular "progressive dinner," and Friday night is the optional Yurt dinner, where we do a short cross-country ski, snowshoe, or catch a lift on a snowmobile out to the yurt in the woods for a catered dinner (alternative dinners at local restaurants are often organized as well). Saturday morning is a group breakfast at my house where your shuttle can pick you up.

Get in early for group houses, better airfares, to set up travel with others,
etc. For full details, schedule and registration see [www.WinterTechForum.com](http://wintertechforum.com).
Attendance is limited to 70.
