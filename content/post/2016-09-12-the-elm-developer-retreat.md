[Developer
Retreats](http://developer-retreat.com/category/what-is-a-developer-retreat.html)
are the most relaxed and low-ceremony events you can imagine, and I've been
very satisfied with the first two.

October 6-9 in Crested Butte CO, we are going to tackle the Elm programming
language and make a start on building the Open-Spaces Board UI. You can find
full details [here](http://developer-retreat.com).

Some of us have been studying Elm a bit already but this will be a group
exploration so if you haven't had any experience with the language yet you're in
good company (although any pre-retreat studying you do will help).

The retreats are still in their formative stage, so there is no fee yet,
although you must still arrange travel, lodging and pay for meals. Details can
be found on the site.
