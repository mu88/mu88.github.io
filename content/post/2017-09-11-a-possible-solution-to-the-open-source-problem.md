William Gross has posted [Give Away Your Code, But Never Your
Time](http://wgross.net/essays/give-away-your-code-but-never-your-time), a
potential and/or partial solution to the problem of funding open source
projects, which I offered a solution for
[here](http://bruceeckel.github.io/2016/06/20/a-model-to-fund-open-source-projects/).
I've since heard from people pointing out projects that
have actually used the "bounty" approach -- I was unintentionally describing something
that already exists.

We've been solving all these other problems around open source, but not the
essential one: how can people get paid for developing open-source software. I
believe this is fundamentally important to the future of our field, because
open source has proven the ability to produce much, much better software than
that produced in hierarchical industrial-age organizations.

Solve this problem, and we'll see an explosion of value like we've never imagined.

Please comment if you know of other strategies for funding open source.
